# Password Strength Checker

The tool is designed to assess the strength of password strings by providing instantaneous visual feedback to the user. The user can improve the strength of their passwords, with a hard focus on breaking the typical bad habits of faulty password formulation.

## Functionality

The web page includes the following features:

   * A password input field
   * A password confirmation field
   * A progress bar for measuring password strength
   * A checklist of password requirements
   * A "Check Score" button that opens a modal window with the password score and feedback

The user must input a password that meets certain criteria to activate the "Check Score" button. The passwords are processed locally, which means that nothing that the user types into the password field will ever be sent online or recorded anywhere.

## JavaScript Functions
