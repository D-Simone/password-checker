											<h5>1. Phishing</h5>
											<p>Phishing is the most popular technique that involves luring the user into
												clicking on an email attachment or a link that contains malware. The
												methods for doing so usually involve sending some important and
												official-looking email that warns to take action before it's too late.
												In the end, password-extracting software is installed automatically or
												the user enters his account details into a look-alike website.</p>
											<h5>2. Malware</h5>
											<p>As you've seen, malware is often part of the phishing technique too.
												However, it can work without the “social engineering” factor if the user
												is naive enough (he usually is). Two of the most common malware types
												for stealing passwords are keyloggers and screen scrapers. As their
												names imply, the former sends all your keystrokes to the hacker, and the
												latter uploads the screenshots.</p>
											<h5>3. Social Engineering</h5>
											<p>Usually, the attacker contacts the victim disguised as a representative
												of some institution, trying to get as much personal info as possible.
												There's also a chance that by posing as a bank or Google agent, he or
												she might get the password or credit card info right away. Contrary to
												the other techniques, social engineering can happen offline by calling
												or even personally meeting the victim.</p>
											<h5>4. Brute Force Attack</h5>
											<p>If all else fails, password crackers have the brute force attack as a
												last resort. It basically involves trying all possible combinations
												until you hit the jackpot. However, password cracking tools allow to
												modify the attack and significantly reduce the time needed to check all
												variations. The user and his habits are the weak links again here.</p>
											<h5>5. Dictionary Attack</h5>
											<p>A dictionary attack is a type of brute force attack and it's often used
												together with other brute force attack types. It automatically checks if
												the password is not some often-used phrase like “iloveyou” by looking at
												the dictionary. The attacker might also add passwords from other leaked
												accounts. In such a scenario, the chance of a successful dictionary
												attack increases substantially.</p>
											<h5>6. Spidering</h5>
											<p>Spidering is a supplementary password cracking technique that helps with
												the above-mentioned brute force and dictionary attacks. It involves
												gathering information about the victim, usually a company, presuming
												that it uses some of that info for password creation. The goal is to
												create a word list that would help guess the password faster.</p>

											<h5>1. Password Manager</h5>
											<p>With the plethora of websites for which you probably have accounts,
												there's simply no way to easily remember every single password without
												duplicating passwords or resorting to some sort of pattern. This is
												where a password manager comes in—as long as you create a strong master
												password that you can remember, that's the last password you'll need to
												deal with.</p>
											<h5>2. Traditional Password Advice</h5>
											<p>According to the traditional advice—which is still good—a strong
												password:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													<b>Has 12 Characters, Minimum</b>: You need to choose a password
													that's long enough. There's no minimum password length everyone
													agrees on, but you should generally go for passwords that are a
													minimum of 12 to 14 characters in length. A longer password would be
													even better.
												</li>
												<li>
													<b>Includes Numbers, Symbols, Capital Letters, and Lower-Case
														Letters</b>: Use a mix of different types of characters to make
													the password harder to crack.
												</li>
												<li>
													<b>Isn't a Dictionary Word or Combination of Dictionary Words</b>:
													Stay away from obvious dictionary words and combinations of
													dictionary words. Any word on its own is bad. Any combination of a
													few words, especially if they're obvious, is also bad. For example,
													“house” is a terrible password. “Red house” is also very bad.
												</li>
												<li>
													<b>Doesn't Rely on Obvious Substitutions</b>: Don't use common
													substitutions, either — for example, “H0use” isn't strong just
													because you've replaced an o with a 0. That's just obvious.
												</li>
											</ul>
											<h5>3. Passphrase Method</h5>
											<p>The traditional advice isn't the only good advice for coming up with a
												password. Throwing all the usual advice out, the passphrase advises
												choosing four random words and stringing them together to create a
												passphrase—a password that involves multiple words. The randomness of
												the word choice and length of the passphrase makes it strong.</p>
											<p>The most important thing to remember here is that the words need to be
												random. For example, <b>"cat in the hat"</b> would be a terrible
												combination because it's such a common phrase and the words make sense
												together. <b>"my beautiful red house"</b> would also be bad because the
												words make grammatical and logical sense together. But, something like
												<b>"correct horse battery staple"</b> or <b>"seashell glaring molasses
													invisible"</b> is random. The words don't make sense together and
												aren't in grammatically correct order, which is good. It should also be
												much easier to remember than a traditional random password.</p>

										<div class="modal-body">
											<h5>1. The Obvious Password</h5>
											<p>Many of the most common password are all variations of consecutive
												numbers. Passwords like <b>123456</b> and even the longer
												<b>1234567890</b> offer no security. We can assume that people use
												passwords like this because they are super easy to type. All it takes is
												running your fingers from left to right across the number row.
											<p>This also applies to passwords like <b>qwerty</b> and <b>qwertyuiop</b>.
												They aren't random strings of characters—they're a row of keys on the
												keyboard that everyone knows.</p>
											<h5>2. The Default Password</h5>
											<p>It's astounding that <b>password</b> is as widely used as it is. A lot of
												devices, such as wireless routers, come with that as the default
												password. However, most of these devices also include warnings that you
												need to change the default password to something more secure once you've
												logged in.</p>
											<p>Unsurprisingly, a lot of people are lazy and either refuse or forget to
												change default passwords. It takes little effort to break into someone's
												Wi-Fi network if they use the default password. There are entire
												websites devoted to cataloging the default passwords for various router
												models, which are freely accessibly for anyone to view.</p>
											<p>So whenever you get a new device or account and you're given a default
												username and password (such as <b>admin/password</b>), do yourself a
												favor and change it immediately. Default passwords are like a rusted-out
												lock that someone can just pull off your gate.</p>
											<h5>3. The Password With No Numbers or Symbols</h5>
											<p>Password length isn't the only important factor in how strong it is.
												Adding in both uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as numbers and
												symbols, lets you maximize the number of possible choices for each
												character in your password.</p>
											<p>If you only use lowercase letters, you have 26 possible choices per
												character. With an eight-character password, that's 26^8 (about 208.8
												billion) possible combinations.</p>
											<p>However, if you use uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers,
												there are now 62 possible choices per character. With the same
												eight-character password, those 62 characters provide 62^8 (about 218.3
												trillion) possibilities.</p>
											<p>That's a colossal difference, and doesn't even factor the dozens of
												available symbols into account!</p>
											<h5>4. The "L33T SP34K" Password</h5>
											<p>When you add numbers and symbols into your password, there's a caveat you
												need to know about. If your password contains complete words, never make
												simple letter-to-number or letter-to-symbol substitutions for individual
												characters.</p>
											<p>For example, if your password is <b>cableCABLE</b>, don't replace the
												<b>a</b> with <b>@</b>, the <b>l</b> with <b>1</b>, the <b>A</b> with
												<b>4</b>, and the <b>E</b> with <b>3</b>. You might think the resulting
												password (<b>c@b1eC4BL3</b>) is a lot stronger than the original, but
												there's a good chance it isn't.</p>
											<p>People who work to break passwords know that people like doing this, so
												if someone tries to break into your accounts, they're going to try all
												these substitutions anyway.</p>
											<h5>5. The "Personal Info" Password</h5>
											<p>So far, we've mostly focused on how to protect your password from people
												cracking it. However, another common way that passwords are compromised
												is from somebody guessing them.</p>
											<p>As such, whenever you're coming up with a new password, never include any
												personal details. A good password should have no relation to you
												whatsoever. A lot of people use a password that includes basic info
												about them like their year of birth, pet's name, or something they
												enjoy.</p>
